##WhiskerTracker

WhiskerTracker is a Matlab based application for tracking head and whisker movements in high-speed movies of freely moving or restrained rodents. 

Multiple tracking modes are supported through a graphical user interface with a small screen footprint. Choose from many pre-processing routines to track any high-speed movie automatically. Manual error correction is built-in.

Increase tracking speeds significantly by batch processing simultaneously with multiple WhiskerTracker instances running on different computers and CPU cores.

##Features
* Cross-platform
* Graphical user interface 
* Automated and manual tracking

##System Requirements
Matlab 2012b or higher recommended (will also run on 6.1 or higher)
Statistics Toolbox
Compiled binaries are included for Windows and Linux (32-bit Matlab)

Note that 64-bit Matlab is currently not supported. C source-code is included and may be compiled
(and then shared!) for 64-bit Matlab (and Mac) with minor modifications.

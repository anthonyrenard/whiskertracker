##WhiskerTracker

WhiskerTracker is a Matlab based application for tracking head and whisker movements in high-speed movies of freely moving or restrained rodents. 

Multiple tracking modes are supported through a graphical user interface with a small screen footprint. Choose from many pre-processing routines to track any high-speed movie automatically. Manual error correction is built-in.

Increase tracking speeds significantly by batch processing simultaneously with multiple WhiskerTracker instances running on different computers and CPU cores.
